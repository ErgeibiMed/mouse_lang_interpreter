# An Interpreter for The Mouse programming language

## Description

   Mouse is an interpreted stack orientated language designed by Peter Grogono around 1975.
   It was designed to be a small but powerful language for microcomputers, similar to Forth,
   but much simpler. One obvious difference to Forth is that Mouse interprets a stream of characters
   most of which are only a single character and it relies more on variables rather than rearranging
   the stack as much.
